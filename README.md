# Vertex_Aligner_Blender_Addon

The Vertex Aligner addon for Blender, a tool designed to help you easily align multiple vertices along a straight line defined by two reference vertices.
It works with Blender 3.4 and older to 3.0

With the Vertex Aligner addon, you can:

- Select two reference vertices to define the alignment direction. Store the global coordinates of the reference vertices with a single click. 
- Select additional vertices and align them along the line formed by the reference vertices. 
The addon features a user-friendly interface, accessible through a dedicated panel in the 3D View. It comes with two easy-to-use buttons that allow you to store the reference vertex coordinates and align the selected vertices with minimal effort.
