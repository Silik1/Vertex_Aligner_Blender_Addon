# Vertex_Aligner_Blender_Addon

The Vertex Aligner addon for Blender, a tool designed to help you easily align multiple vertices along a straight line defined by two reference vertices.

With the Vertex Aligner addon, you can:

- Select two reference vertices to define the alignment direction. Store the global coordinates of the reference vertices with a single click. 
- Select additional vertices and align them along the line formed by the reference vertices. 
The addon features a user-friendly interface, accessible through a dedicated panel in the 3D View. It comes with two easy-to-use buttons that allow you to store the reference vertex coordinates and align the selected vertices with minimal effort.

## How to use it ? 

To use the Vertex Aligner addon, follow these simple steps:


- In Edit Mode, select two vertices to serve as reference points for the alignment direction.
- Click the "Stores coordinates" button in the panel to store their global coordinates.

Align additional vertices along the line formed by the reference vertices:

- Select the vertices you want to align.
- Click the "Align selected vertices" button in the panel.

That's it! The selected vertices will now be aligned along the straight line defined by the two reference vertices. The Vertex Aligner addon is a powerful tool to improve the precision and efficiency of your modeling workflow in Blender.
