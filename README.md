# Vertex_Aligner_Blender_Addon
The Vertex Aligner addon for Blender, a tool designed to help you easily align multiple vertices along a straight line defined by two reference vertices.

With the Vertex Aligner addon, you can:

Select two reference vertices to define the alignment direction.
Store the global coordinates of the reference vertices with a single click.
Select additional vertices and align them along the line formed by the reference vertices.
The addon features a user-friendly interface, accessible through a dedicated panel in the 3D View. It comes with two easy-to-use buttons that allow you to store the reference vertex coordinates and align the selected vertices with minimal effort.

Whether you're working on architectural models, mechanical designs, or organic shapes, the Vertex Aligner addon is the perfect tool to ensure precise alignment and improve your modeling workflow in Blender.
